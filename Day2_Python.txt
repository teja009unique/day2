---->  Definition of Python :
       Python is High level, Interpreted and Dynamically typed programming language.
	
	* High level programmimg language:
	  High level languages are programming languages which are used for writing programs or software which could be understood by humans and computer.

	* Interpreted language:
	  Interpreter executes line by line.
	  Interpreter takes more time than compiler to execute because in Interpreted language machine will convert every line in byte code.
	  So, each line is converted into byte code and checks errors and continues.So, they are slow.

	* Dynamically typed programming language:
	  No need to specify the data types.
	  In the runtime, whichever is the datatype, it will assign themselves.
	  Dynamically typed programming languages are the languages where the data types are initialised at run time.


---->  Variable:
       Variables are labels on top of registers.


---->  Type Coversion Methods :
       There are 3 type conversion methods in python.
       They are int(), str(), float().
       Type Conversion Methods converts the type of the variable.
       Ex: 
	   a=1;
	   print(a)
	   print(type(a))
           b=str(a)
	   print(b)
	   print(type(b))


	   o/p: 1
		<class 'int'>
		1
		<class 'str'>
